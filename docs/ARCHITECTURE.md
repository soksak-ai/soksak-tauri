# soksak Architecture — The Skeleton Contract (v1)

This is the authoritative v1 architecture contract for soksak. It is binding on the core (the skeleton) and on every plugin. Where this document and code disagree, fix the code. Where this document and a single-source-of-truth schema disagree, the schema wins for what it can enforce and this document wins for everything it cannot.

Korean copy: [ARCHITECTURE.ko.md](ARCHITECTURE.ko.md) — the English text is canonical.

## 1. Identity and Purpose

soksak is a skeleton. It manages common interfaces and nothing else.

**The skeleton IS:**
- A host for content panes that have no opinion about their content.
- A registry substrate: one command registry, one program (+menu) registry, one view-placement registry, one capability API, one event bus.
- A native substrate: window/pane/layout, child-webview hosting, PTY spawning, filesystem, data store, secrets vault, process and network clients — exposed as **generic** capabilities.
- A single point of contact for CLI, MCP, and Skill surfaces — auto-derived from the command registry.

**The skeleton IS NOT:**
- A terminal. The skeleton spawns PTYs; it does not render an xterm.
- A browser. The skeleton hosts child webviews; it does not own a URL bar.
- A file explorer or an editor. The skeleton reads files and hands out a bare content slot; the file-viewing and editing experience — and the editor engine itself — are replaceable plugins.
- A place for feature logic. Terminal, browser, file explorer, and editor are independent plugins, weakly coupled to the skeleton.

The skeleton renders no content. Every concrete content surface arrives through one of four attachment seams (Section 3). A plugin that needs a private path into the skeleton is a defect in the skeleton, not a feature of the plugin.

The skeleton ships with zero content plugins. A fresh install opens to an empty frame; terminal, editor, files, and browser are installed and enabled on demand like any other plugin — there is no bundled-default or seed mechanism.

---

## 2. The Substrate — What the Skeleton Owns

The skeleton owns exactly these common interfaces. Each line states the guarantee. Nothing concrete (no xterm, no URL bar, no file-type switch) lives here.

| Interface | Source | Guarantee |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Window / Pane / Layout** | `src/state/sessions.ts` | Owns the layout tree (`GroupNode`, `ViewGroup`, `View`, `ContentArea`). Splits, moves, closes, maximizes, resizes panes. The tree is opaque to plugins — never exposed, only mutated through commands. A group may hold zero views (empty tab); the skeleton runs no program of its own, so a fresh project / new content tab / fully-closed group opens to an empty pane, and the last view in a single group can be closed (the group stays, emptied). Views are added only through the program (+menu) seam. |
| **Project identity & single-open** | `src/lib/workspace.ts` (constitution P1–P6), `frameworks/tauri/src/project_registry.rs` | A project's identity is its root path (P4); one root is open in at most one window across the whole app (P6). The Rust singleton registry is the enforcement point — every open/close path goes through `src/state/projectRegistry.ts`; a conflict focuses the owning window instead of opening a duplicate; window destruction releases its claims. |
| **Workspace persistence & restore** | `src/state/workspaceBoot.ts`, `src/state/workspacePersistence.ts`, `src/state/hydration.ts` — principles in [RESTORE.md](RESTORE.md) | Restart restores windows (frame, focus), tabs, splits, terminal cwd, and repainted command blocks. History is ownership-delegated (blocks to the terminal plugin, TUI transcripts to the TUI itself, lineage links only); restore and unlock re-hydrate share one path; visible views mount first, the rest fill in idle order. |
| **Generic content-pane hosting** | `src/components/GroupArea.tsx`, `src/components/PluginViewHost.tsx` | Renders one persistent off-screen-parkable slot per `view.id`. The slot is a bare container. The skeleton attaches no renderer to it beyond the plugin-provider mount contract. |
| **Command registry (single source of truth)** | `src/commands/registry.ts` | One registry. Every command (core or plugin) registers once with a typed param schema and danger gate. `catalogJson()` auto-exposes the same set to CLI, MCP, and docs. No command exists outside this registry. |
| **Capability API (`app.*`)** | `src/plugins/api.ts` | The only runtime surface a plugin receives. Permission-gated: an undeclared permission yields an absent (undefined) capability. Namespaced per plugin (`data[ns=pluginId]`, `secrets[ns=pluginId]`, `plugin.<id>.<cmd>`). |
| **Event bus** | `src/plugins/hooks.ts`, `src/plugins/bus.ts` | System events (`project.*`, `file.*`, `command.*`, `turn.ended`, `theme.changed`, `locale.changed`, `app.focus`, `bookmarks.changed`) are permission-gated. `bus.*` is plugin-to-plugin pub/sub independent of core state. |
| **Program (+menu) registry** | `src/plugins/programRegistry.ts` | Declarative `contributes.programs[]`. Each program declares a `kind`. The +menu and `tab.open` route by `kind`. Plugins declare programs; the skeleton routes them. |
| **View placement & focus registry** | `src/plugins/viewRegistry.ts`, `src/plugins/viewFocus.ts` | `registerView(viewId, provider)` with placements (`content`, `sidebar-left`, `sidebar-right`, `footer`). Mount/unmount owns lifetime. Optional `prepareFocusTransfer` / `focus` form the only keyboard-focus boundary: core owns the destination and ordering; a provider may touch only its own container. Mount is never focus intent, and deferred focus must honor the supplied `AbortSignal`. |
| **Native generic capabilities** | `frameworks/tauri/src/*` | PTY spawn/IO/flow-control (`pty.rs`), child-webview lifecycle + layer inversion + hole-punch (`browser.rs`), media proxy (`mediaproxy.rs`), data store (rusqlite + FTS5), secrets vault, process/WebSocket/HTTP clients, filesystem. All generic — none named after a concrete feature consumer. |

The native layer stays in the skeleton because PTY kernel objects and platform webviews (WKWebView / WebView2) cannot cross the plugin boundary. The skeleton exposes them as generic capabilities; plugins consume them as thin clients.

---

## 3. The Weak-Coupling Model — The Only Attachment Seams

A plugin attaches to the skeleton through exactly four seams. There are no others. There is no private channel, no direct store import, no back door into native commands.

1. **Programs (+menu).** `contributes.programs[]` declares an entry with a `kind`. The skeleton routes selection to the matching capability. This is how a plugin appears in the +menu.

2. **Views (placements and focus).** `contributes.views[]` + `registerView(viewId, provider)` mounts a provider into a generic slot at a declared placement. The provider receives only the view context (Section 4, A2). Core routes focus intent by stable `viewId`; source providers synchronously seal transient input through `prepareFocusTransfer`, then target providers focus their own canonical input through `focus`. Providers never inspect or focus another view's DOM.

3. **Commands.** `app.commands.register(name, spec)` registers one command with a typed param schema and danger gate. It auto-exposes to CLI/MCP. Manifest `contributes.commands` declares intent; runtime binds.

4. **Capabilities.** `app.*` methods, gated by declared permissions, plus `app.events.on(...)` and `app.bus.*`. This is the only runtime surface.

Anything a plugin cannot express through these four seams, the plugin must not do. If a real plugin cannot be built within these seams, the skeleton is missing a generic capability — add the capability (Section 5), never a private path.

---

## 4. Principles (A1–A17)

These are HARD. They are stated absolutely on purpose.

### A1. Core renders no concrete content.
The skeleton hardcodes no terminal renderer, no browser chrome, no file-type renderer. `GroupArea` dispatches by an opaque `view.id` into a bare slot. A `view.kind` string is a routing label, not a license to embed an implementation. Concrete renderers (xterm, URL bar, CodeMirror strategy switch) move to plugins.

### A2. The view context is the only data channel into a view.
A plugin view receives state through its `PluginViewContext` and through `app.*` capabilities. It must not import core Zustand stores, reach into `sessions`/`settings`/`ui`, or read the layout tree. Plugins must not reach into core stores. The context carries identity (`projectId`, `root`, pane/view identity) and nothing the skeleton has not chosen to hand over.

### A3. Generic capability only — no view-specific hooks.
Every capability the skeleton exposes must be feature-neutral. No `onBrowserNavigated` baked into the core; expose generic webview events. No terminal-only spawn endpoint dressed as core; expose a generic pane/PTY capability. A capability named after one consumer is a lock-in and is prohibited. Existing feature-named events (`browser-nav`, `native-mousedown`) are migration debt, not the contract — they generalize per Section 5. (The `browser_*` invoke layer was renamed `webview_*` per docs/NAMING.md — file `webview.rs`.)

### A4. No core lock-in.
The skeleton must not assume terminal/browser/files are built-in. View kinds, program kinds, and routing must be data-driven, not a fixed enum the skeleton special-cases. Adding a new content subsystem must require zero edits to the skeleton.

### A5. Single source of truth is the schema/spec.
`src/plugins/spec.ts` (manifest, permissions, contributions) and `src/commands/registry.ts` (command catalog) are the single sources of truth. Prose in this document adds only advice the schema cannot enforce. Do not restate, in prose, what a schema already enforces; do not invent constraints a schema does not back.

### A6. Idempotent.
Every plugin action must be safe to repeat. Activation, autorun, view mount, and command execution must converge to the same state whether run once or many times. A plugin reloaded mid-session must reconcile from current state, not assume a clean boot.

### A7. Independent.
Each plugin is its own git repository with its own build, tests, and lifecycle. A plugin must not depend on the internal source of the skeleton or of another plugin beyond declared manifest `dependencies`. The skeleton resolves transitive dependencies and cascade-removal; plugins do not.

### A8. Removable (the separation test).
Removing any plugin must leave the skeleton and all unrelated plugins fully functional. Disabling a plugin closes its views and unregisters its commands/programs with no orphaned native resources. If removing a plugin breaks the skeleton, the coupling is illegal.

### A9. Zero-core-change to add (the combination test).
Adding a new plugin must require zero changes to the skeleton. If a new plugin forces a skeleton edit, the skeleton is missing a generic capability — close that gap in the substrate, then add the plugin with no core diff.

### A10. Theme via host CSS variables.
Plugin views inherit theme strictly through host-injected CSS custom properties propagated into the shadow root. A plugin must not read the theme store, hardcode palette values, or branch on theme name. Recoloring the host recolors every conforming plugin with no plugin change.

### A11. The editor is a plugin; the skeleton routes, it does not edit.
Opening a path as content flows through a generic skeleton routing command (`ui.intent.open` — open-path-as-content) that dispatches to whichever plugin registered a viewer for that file type (`registerFileViewer`). The skeleton owns no editor instance and vends no editor engine. The editor plugin owns its engine (CodeMirror by default, Monaco or any other by substitution), bundles it itself, and exposes its own extension surface; formatter and language plugins depend on the editor plugin through manifest `dependencies`, not on the skeleton. Active-file read/write is the editor plugin's capability, mediated through the command/event surface — not a skeleton-owned editor.

### A12. Verify, never assume.
Conformance is proven, not asserted (Section 6). "Looks decoupled" is not decoupled. A grep that returns matches is a failing separation test, not a stylistic note.

### A13. Engine-neutral primitives — the skeleton fixes no engine.
The skeleton exposes only engine-neutral raw substrate: raw PTY bytes, file IO, an OS-webview hosting primitive (one option among possible rendering approaches), and a bare content-pane surface. It fixes no concrete engine. The terminal emulator (xterm or other), the editor engine (CodeMirror or Monaco), and the browser engine (OS webview or Chromium) are each a plugin's replaceable choice. A capability only one engine can satisfy — a CodeMirror `Extension` type, an xterm addon, a WebKit-only eval shape — does not belong in the skeleton; it belongs in the plugin that owns that engine. Where an alternative engine needs a primitive the skeleton lacks (e.g. embedding an external Chromium surface), add it generically when that plugin is built (A9); never special-case one engine. A headless engine is still an engine: the VT interpreter that turns terminal bytes into screen state (an alacritty_terminal-backed mirror) reads the *meaning* of the bytes and bundles engine code, so it fails the core-primitive test's second leg (NAMING §3(b): core bundles no engine code) exactly as Chromium does — it lives outside core, as an engine-named terminal sidecar (`soksak-sidecar-terminal-alacritty` by default), the terminal-domain analog of `soksak-sidecar-browser-chromium`; it implements the engine-neutral contract `soksak-spec-sidecar-terminal`, which `-wezterm`, `-vt100`, and `-ghostty` units implement in its place. The contract's text, its acceptance suite, and its benchmarks live in `soksak-contract-terminal` (NAMING §4a), outside every implementation. Its runtime model differs from Chromium's — a headless survival service, not a surface-bound in-process engine (A14) — but the ruling is identical: interpretation is engine, and engine is not core. The raw PTY substrate underneath (spawn, bytes, the ring with its sequence, flow control) carries no interpretation and stays core by the test's first leg.

### A14. Heavy plugin-specific native code is a sidecar, not a skeleton dependency.
The skeleton's native dependencies are limited to **host-only primitives it alone can provide** — PTY allocation, an `Origin`-less WebSocket, UDP, the in-memory-key secrets vault, file IO, the OS-webview host — and the generic capabilities built on them. Heavy native code that serves **one** feature and that a JS plugin physically cannot run (a P2P transport stack, a protocol implementation, a fingerprinting HTTP fork) does **not** belong in the skeleton binary. A compile-time dependency would still link it into the skeleton and defeat the thin-skeleton goal; so such code lives in **its own plugin repo as a sidecar binary**, spawned through the `process` capability and talking to the skeleton over the socket — **vendored + hash-pinned**. The decision, in order:
1. **Can a JS plugin do it through existing capabilities?** → it is a JS plugin (e.g. clubhouse over `app.process`/`app.data`).
2. **Is it a host-only primitive that neither a JS plugin nor a separate process can replicate** (PTY, `Origin`-less socket, in-memory-key vault, fs, the webview)? → it is a **generic skeleton capability**.
3. **Is it heavy native code that must render into the app's own windows** (process-local NSView parenting — a separate process physically cannot attach)? → it is an **engine sidecar**: an in-process dylib behind the generic engine-hosting primitive (`app.sidecar` — docs/SIDECARS.md). The skeleton links nothing and understands none of its messages; it dlopens at plugin request, verifies the binary's ABI self-report against the plugin's declaration, hands over the surface, and relays.
4. **Is it heavy, self-contained, plugin-specific native code** — not JS-able, not a generic primitive, not surface-bound? → it is a **service sidecar binary in its own repo**, spawned through the `process` capability.
Example: the remote-control stack (iroh QUIC + Noise) is `soksak-plugin-remote-iroh`, a service sidecar; the skeleton links no `iroh`. The Chromium browser engine is `soksak-sidecar-browser-chromium`, an engine sidecar; the skeleton links no Chromium/CEF. A swappable engine takes the engine's name (`remote-iroh`, `browser-chromium`), per the plugin-naming convention.

### A15. Unify the interface, not the crate.
When two backends genuinely differ (plain first-party HTTP vs browser-impersonation HTTP; a stable client vs a fingerprint-spoofing fork), do **not** force them into one crate. The skeleton keeps both implementations and exposes **one capability with opt-in modes** (e.g. `net.http.request` with `impersonate?: "off" | "chrome"`). Plugins call the capability; they never bundle their own HTTP/WS/PTY. Every capability used by one or more plugins is a generic command-registry capability — permission-gated, ns-isolated, CLI/MCP auto-exposed — like `app.data` over SQLite, so the wheel is invented once. Consolidate the **interface**; keep the implementations that genuinely differ (and if they must coexist, the reason is recorded, not hidden).

### A16. Core→plugin extraction is a move, not a rewrite.
When a subsystem leaves the skeleton its code **moves verbatim**; only the integration seam changes (an in-process call becomes a socket/capability call). The verified code and its tests travel intact — never re-implemented. The skeleton-side commit says **"separated from core"**; never "ported", "migrated", "transplanted", "realized", or "rewritten". (A8's separation test proves the removal; this rule governs how the code travels.)


### A17. One identity, one home — nothing is shared across identities.
Each app identity (`com.soksak.app` → `~/.soksak`, `com.soksak.dev` → `~/.soksak-dev`, `com.soksak.debug` → `~/.soksak-debug`) owns a complete, independent home: data DB, plugins, sidecars, themes, projects, secrets vault, backups, and the socket all derive from that one root (`home.rs soksak_home()` — the single truth; a new identity gets its own home automatically from the identifier's last segment). Sharing any of it lets state cross identity boundaries — measured: a shared Chromium profile's ProcessSingleton forwarded the second app's engine launch to the first (a stray native window there, blank browser views here). The identity home is a fixed derivation from the bundle identifier with no runtime env override — not even under a debug or test name (a distribution invariant, enforced by `distribution-invariants-scan`, that stops one identity from pointing at another's home). A black-box e2e isolates *within* the real identity home instead of relocating it: `SOKSAK_DATA_DIR` puts the SQLite DB and `SOKSAK_VAULT_PATH` the vault in a disposable directory (both `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`-gated), while the home's installed plugins and sidecars stay in place. To reach such an app from the CLI, set `SOKSAK_SOCKET` to its explicit socket path. Also in **debug builds only**, `SOKSAK_E2E_KEK` supplies a deterministic vault KEK (SHA-256 of its value) so black-box e2e opens the vault without a keychain; it is `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`-gated and compiled out of release, so no env key material ever ships (the release env-unlock `SOKSAK_VAULT_KEY` was removed). The `sok` CLI is a standalone busybox binary and implements the same contract (`cli/src/main.rs home_for_env`); this section is that contract's canonical statement. The release home holds **installed artifacts only** — registry-installed plugins (semver-self-described) and hash-pinned sidecar dists fetched from GitHub releases; no development source ever enters it. The dev surfaces are identity-gated off in release: `plugin.dev.*` refuses, and folders self-described `version=dev|local` are rejected at load. There is no ambient env source injection in any identity — the designated home directories (plugins, sidecars/dist) are the only standing resolution paths; a one-off external plugin load goes through the explicit `plugin.dev.load` command, and a fresh sidecar build is staged into the identity home via `stage.sh`.

## 5. Extraction Targets

For each subsystem: what STAYS in the skeleton (the generic interface), what MOVES to the plugin (the concrete implementation), and the generic capability the skeleton must expose. Gaps are cited from the grounded subsystem maps.

### Terminal → plugin

**Status: extracted, and now a replaceable engine seam.** `soksak-plugin-terminal-xterm`
(xterm.js) and `soksak-plugin-terminal-ghostty` both implement `soksak-spec-plugin-terminal`; the core
names no terminal engine and hardcodes no default program (an unspecified `pane.split` is a
blank panel, not a terminal). Consumers (agents, ⌘T) reference the contract via `viewContract`
and the core resolves it to the user-selected implementer (NAMING §4, §8). The ruling below is
the original extraction plan it was carried out under.

**STAYS (skeleton):** PTY spawn/kill, reader thread, ACK flow control, ZSH integration injection, environment cleanup (`pty.rs`); pane host registry and DOM-preserving slot (`paneHosts.ts`, `GroupArea`); command-lifecycle and cwd event bridge (`hooks.ts`).

**MOVES (plugin):** xterm.js instantiation, renderer selection (WebGL/DOM), font/cell-metric handling, IME/OSC-11 wiring, terminal theme palette, terminal-specific settings UI (`createTerminal.ts`, `theme.ts`).

**Generic capability the skeleton must expose (gaps D1–D7, risks E1–E9):**
- `app.terminal.createPane(opts: {cwd?, shell?, initialCommand?}) → paneId` — plugin requests a PTY-backed pane (gap D1).
- Raw IO surface: `onData(paneId, cb)` (pre-render bytes) and `ackTerminal(paneId, bytes)` — custom renderer drives flow control (gaps D3, E3).
- Pane-host ownership for plugins: a container ref or `getHostDiv(paneId)` plus `onTerminalMount/Unmount(paneId)` (gaps D2, capability-map B2).
- Per-pane spawn interception (`onSpawnRequest`) and per-pane settings application (gaps D6, D7).
- Pluggable shell-integration / `setCwd(paneId, path)` fallback for non-OSC shells (gaps D4, E8).
- Window-scoped pane registry keyed by `${windowLabel}:${paneId}` (risk E1).

**Ruling:** extractable. The renderer leaves; the kernel-bound substrate stays.

### Browser → plugin

**STAYS (skeleton):** child-webview lifecycle (`webview_open/close/bounds/visible/navigate/eval/list` — renamed from `browser_*` per docs/NAMING.md), macOS layer inversion + hole-punch + native input monitors, media proxy, view routing, GC infrastructure (`webview.rs`, `mediaproxy.rs`).

**MOVES (plugin):** URL bar, back/forward/reload, bookmarks UI, devtools toggle, the `kind:"browser"` view-type definition and `BrowserView.tsx` chrome.

**Generic capability the skeleton must expose (browser-map gaps D1–D10, risks E1–E10):**
- `app.webview.label(hint) → label` — app-level, Tauri-global-unique label coordination across windows (gap D1, risk E1).
- Generic webview events: `webview.on(label, "nav"|"title"|"open-external"|"status", cb)` replacing hardcoded `browser-*` event names (gap D2, principle A3).
- Generic `ui.overlayActive(label, bool)` and `ui.domHoles(label, holes[])` replacing `webview_overlay_active` (gap D3 — the invoke was renamed; the generic registry surface is still the target).
- Generic `native.click.on(label, cb)` and resize subscription, scoped via `emit_to(label, ...)` (gap D4, risk E4).
- Cross-platform `webview.eval(label, js)` and `webview.injectScript(label, {script, phase})` with graceful degradation (gaps D5, D8, risk E5).
- `webview.list(prefix)` for GC parity (risk E6).

**Ruling:** extractable as a thin client over native webview commands. The native webview substrate cannot move; only the chrome and view-type move.

### Files / File Explorer → plugin

**STAYS (skeleton):** `read_text_file`, `file_metadata`, `asset://` streaming, `watch_dir`, the generic content slot, and the generic open-path-as-content routing command. No editor engine, no CodeMirror module authority.

**MOVES (plugin):** the file-type strategy switch (code/markdown/image/pdf/video/audio), the file-viewer chrome, the `kind:"file"` view-type, and any file-tree explorer UI (`FileViewer.tsx`).

**Generic capability the skeleton must expose (hosting-map D3, capability-map editor gaps):**
- `registerFileViewer(priority, strategies)` or plugin-view contribution for custom file types, so the concrete viewer is replaceable (hosting-map D3 verdict).
- `file.activated` event / `onActiveFileChange(cb)` (capability-map gap).
- Engine-specific surfaces removed from the skeleton (A13): `api.editor.modules`, `registerExtension` (CodeMirror `Extension`), and `registerLanguage` move to the editor plugin's own extension API. `registerFormatter` (text→text) is engine-neutral; its placement (skeleton vs editor plugin) is settled in the editor stage.

**Ruling:** the explorer and the file-viewing experience extract; file IO stays. The editor module substrate does not stay — it moves with the editor plugin (see Editor below).

### Editor → plugin

**STAYS (skeleton):** file IO (`read_text_file`, `write_text_file`, `file_metadata`, `asset://`, `watch_dir`), the generic content slot, the generic open-path-as-content routing command, and cross-window state consistency via `app.data.watch` (the Rust singleton broadcast). No editor engine.

**MOVES (plugin):** the CodeMirror 6 instance, per-view tab/undo authority, the code/text file viewer, the editor extension/language API, and the `@codemirror/*` bundle. The editor plugin owns its engine and may be replaced by a Monaco-based (or other) editor plugin with no skeleton change.

**Generic capability the skeleton must expose:** generic open-path-as-content routing to `registerFileViewer`; `file.activated` event; cross-window file-state consistency (existing `app.data.watch`). Engine-specific surfaces (`api.editor.modules`, `registerExtension`, `registerLanguage`) are removed from the skeleton (A13).

**Ruling:** extractable in v1. Multi-window file-state consistency is achieved through the existing cross-window data broadcast, not a skeleton-owned editor. The editor is a plugin like the others; formatter and language plugins depend on it, not on the skeleton.

### Remote transport (iroh) → plugin **sidecar** (A14 — the native-sidecar pattern, not a JS plugin)

The first extraction that is **native code a JS plugin cannot run**, so it leaves as a spawned sidecar binary, not a JS plugin over a skeleton capability. (`soksak-plugin-remote-iroh`, completed.)

**STAYS (skeleton):** nothing of the transport or the crypto. Only the **desktop confirm modal** (`RemoteConfirmModal`, a skeleton webview surface) and a `remote.confirm` command — the human-decision gate for destructive remote actions — stay, because the human authority lives where the webview is. Dispatch reuses the existing `request_command` → `route()` socket path.

**MOVES (sidecar):** the entire `remote/` stack — iroh (QUIC P2P + relay), Noise (`snow`), the Ed25519 device-auth floor, and the session/transport/tcp/tunnel/pairing floors — plus the `iroh`/`snow`/`ed25519-dalek` static-key Cargo tree. Into `soksak-plugin-remote-iroh` (its own git repo), built as a sidecar binary, vendored + sha256-pinned, spawned via the `process` capability.

**Two seams only (A16 — move, not rewrite):** the 24 floor files moved **byte-identical**; only `bridge.rs` changed. ① **dispatch** — the in-process `request_command(app, …)` became a `SOKSAK_SOCKET` JSON-RPC call (same wire). ② **confirm** — the in-process `app.emit("remote-confirm-request")` became a socket round-trip: the sidecar requests `remote.confirm`, the skeleton shows the modal and returns the human decision; the phone still cannot self-approve.

**Ruling:** extractable as a native sidecar. Unlike Terminal/Browser/Files/Editor (JS plugins over skeleton primitives), this is heavy, self-contained, plugin-specific native code, so it is a spawned binary in its own repo — and the skeleton binary drops the whole iroh tree (~13 MB, measured 33M → 20M). Swappable transport engine → engine in the name (`remote-iroh`; future `remote-yamux`/`remote-cloudflared`). The verified floor tests (271) moved with the code and stay green in the sidecar.

### Chromium browser engine → **engine sidecar** (A14 step 3 — surface-bound native code; completed)

The first engine-model sidecar: the bundled Chromium engine renders into pane surfaces, so
it cannot be a separate process (process-local NSView parenting) — it is an in-process dylib
(`soksak-sidecar-browser-chromium`, `crates/`) loaded by the skeleton's generic engine-hosting
primitive (`frameworks/tauri/src/sidecar.rs`, `app.sidecar`; ABI in docs/SIDECARS.md).

**MOVES (verbatim, A16):** the whole engine — GCD message pump with re-entrancy guards, the
gated render tick, `do_close=1` + deferred-reap close sequence, in-memory profile, popup
routing, child bounds/flip-y. `frameworks/tauri/src/cef_engine.rs` → the standalone repo
`soksak-ai/soksak-sidecar-browser-chromium` (`src/engine.rs`; dev checkout lives at the sidecar
home `~/.soksak/sidecars/soksak-sidecar-browser-chromium`).

**Seams only:** ① bootstrap — env-pointed framework/helper paths became dist-relative
(own-location resolution), and the browser process no longer re-executes as its own
subprocess (a dedicated helper binary owns `execute_process`); ② events — the global
`app.emit("cef-popup")` became a host-vtable emit on the per-caller channel, carrying the
source browser id; ③ control — the `browser.cef.*` registry commands and `cef_browser_*`
invokes were **deleted**, replaced by the opaque plugin↔sidecar protocol
(`soksak-spec-sidecar-browser`) the skeleton relays without understanding.

**Ruling:** the skeleton links zero Chromium/CEF (the `cef-browser` cargo feature is gone);
the consumed library's name lives only inside the engine crate (NAMING.md §2). Verified by
the separation grep gate plus sok E2E on the sidecar path (paint, tab-switch hide/restore,
modal occlusion, close, idle CPU 0).

## 6. Conformance

Separation and combination are tested, not claimed.

### Separation test (A8 — removable)
- **Grep gate:** searching the skeleton for hardcoded references to concrete subsystems (an xterm import in `GroupArea`, a `browser-nav` literal outside the migration shim, a `view.kind === "file"` strategy switch carrying renderer logic) must return **zero** matches outside the declared generic substrate. A nonzero count is a failing test.
- **Disable-and-survive:** disable each plugin via `plugin.disable`; the skeleton and unrelated plugins remain fully functional with no orphaned PTYs, webviews, or registered commands.

### Combination test (A9 — zero-core-change to add)
- Adding a plugin produces **zero diff** in skeleton source. The plugin attaches only through the four seams (Section 3). Any required skeleton edit fails the test and signals a missing generic capability (Section 5).

### Build and registry gate
- `make verify` is green: manifest validation (`spec.ts`), command-registry consistency (`catalogJson()`), and dependency-graph resolution pass.
- Every command is reachable from the registry; no command exists outside it.

### CLI / E2E self-check
- Every plugin capability is exercised through the command surface via the socket E2E harness (`SOKSAK_SOCKET`): drive the real app, run the command, read the result, prove RED→GREEN. "No feature to test it" is not an excuse — use the generic surface (`data.*`, `secret.*`, `ui.tree`/`ui.input.click`) with symmetric open env for isolation.

### Visual verify (UI)
- UI conformance is not satisfied by headless DOM assertions. Capture with `window.snapshot`, read the PNG, confirm the view inherits host theme variables (A10) and renders without native-layer bleed-through, then iterate until correct.

## 7. The Coupling Law (C1–C5)

This section is law, not description. It gives the identity of Section 1 ("The skeleton IS NOT") and the weak-coupling model of Section 3 their enforcement clauses, and it extends the coupling discipline from the plugin↔skeleton seam to plugin↔plugin coupling. Every gate named here is blocking from the day it lands. Never accumulate experimental gates — a gate that cannot block is not a gate; it is backlog.

> Legislated by the user (Korean original in [ARCHITECTURE.ko.md](ARCHITECTURE.ko.md) §7): "The core strongly couples to nothing. Everything is opened and rule-bound so that plugins interact through interfaces and fulfill their own roles. Expose every DOM, expose every command, expose every status, and connect and process data transparently. Plugins do not strongly couple to each other either."

### C1. The core knows no specific plugin and no specific feature.
Never write a plugin id into core source. The mechanical gate scans the execution-path code of `src/` and `frameworks/tauri/` (handlers, constants, branches) for the string `soksak-plugin-` and must return zero matches. The scan carries an explicit allowlist — command `examples` strings (a real plugin id in an example is replaced by the placeholder `soksak-plugin-<id>`), spec package names in comments, and the single registry repo URL constant — and the allowlist never grows except through the C5 procedure. Core UI never computes feature data of its own: decorations, badges, and status displays act only as consumers of registry commands and events. Never park a primitive under a feature namespace. This clause adds enforcement to Section 1 and to A3/A4; it adds no new identity.

### C2. Every feature exposes three surfaces — the transparency triple.
- **command** — a plugin with views and zero commands does not pass (gate: views > 0 ∧ commands = 0 → fail).
- **status** — every view reports its state through the status axis; a view the status axis cannot see does not pass.
- **DOM** — every interactive UI is exposed through `contributes.nodes` / `ui.tree`, and the `ui.input.click` path is guaranteed. Never ship an element that can only be reached by guessing selectors.

A feature missing any of the three surfaces is unfinished — don't ship it. The doctor/conformance gates for all three are blocking on introduction.

### C3. Plugins couple through contracts only — the coupling ladder.
Section 3 fixes the plugin↔skeleton seams; this ladder fixes plugin↔plugin coupling.
- **L0 — internal trespass: forbidden.** Never reach into another plugin's private DOM, internal state, file locations, or load order. The runtime error stays.
- **L1 — implementation name-pin: forbidden.** A consumer never selects another plugin id as its capability boundary.
- **L2 — contract-pin: required.** Providers declare `{id,version}` in `implements`; consumers declare `{id,range}` in `consumes`. Discovery is contract-addressed and implementation-blind; conformance proves declared ≡ actual.
- **L3 — events/data: declared schemas only.** `contributes.events` is a verified target, not decoration. Never emit or consume an undeclared shape.

### C4. Contract identity and compatibility are explicit.
Contract ids follow `soksak-spec-<kind>-<domain>`. A provider exposes a full SemVer version; a consumer exposes a SemVer range. The `0.0.1` first-party baseline makes no compatibility promise, so first-party consumers use the exact range `0.0.1`. A compatibility claim changes only with a versioned contract and matching conformance evidence.

### C5. Standards never weaken silently.
Never lower a standard because the implementation fails to meet it. When a test is red against a correct standard, fix the implementation, fixture, document, or exposed interface. When the standard itself is wrong, state the conflicting evidence and make a versioned standard change with matching tests. Silent relaxation and silent exceptions are forbidden.
