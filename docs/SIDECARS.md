# Sidecars (v1)

Normative definition of sidecars: shared binaries consumed by plugins. This document
owns the taxonomy, the engine-model C ABI, lifecycle, plugin declaration, and
distribution. PLUGIN-CONTRACT.md §5 defers here for the engine model.

## 1. Taxonomy

The classification axis is **who consumes the contract**:

- **Sidecar** — consumed by *plugins*. A shared binary that plugins drive over a
  private protocol. The core is a blind host/relay: it never understands the
  messages. Never exposed in the `sok` command registry.
- **Extension (core extension)** — consumed by the *core capability seam*: a
  provider of a core capability (e.g. a transport provider). Different concept,
  reserved name; out of scope here.

Sidecars come in two **models** (an orthogonal axis: runtime shape, not identity):

| | `service` | `engine` |
|---|---|---|
| Runs as | separate process (`app.process` spawn) | in-process dylib (core dlopen) |
| Surface | none (headless) | renders into pane surfaces (NSView) |
| Channel | stdio (spawner-bound — see the wire rule below); or NDJSON over a UDS for a survival service (§1 survival clause) | opaque JSON over the hosting ABI |
| Self-description | none (manifest-less, unchanged standard) | exported C symbols (binary is the single truth) |
| Core awareness | none — core doesn't know it is a sidecar | loads + verifies + relays, understands nothing |

Why `engine` must be in-process: on macOS a parent NSView is process-local — a
separate process cannot attach a child view to the app's windows, and the
engine's message pump needs the app's main queue. Loaded into the app process,
it still runs "not as a separate app" (no Dock, no own windows).

**The service `Channel` wire.** Soksak-authored resident service sidecars use one wire and
one serve harness: `soksak-spec-service` at provider version `0.0.1`, owned by
docs/PLUGIN-SERVICE.md. **External-tool adapters** — a plugin spawning a third-party binary that
speaks its own protocol (acp → claude/codex over ACP; media pipelines → yt-dlp/ffmpeg
one-shot) — keep a private contract, because we do not own the spawned binary's wire.
The common service wire applies only to the stdio-service axis; engine and external-tool
protocols remain independently owned.

The service axis runs in two drive modes on that one wire: **plugin-driven** (core-blind
— the plugin JS spawns and drives it, the row above) and **core-routed** (the core
spawns, frames, and routes its `bind:"service"` commands — declared with a manifest
`service` block, `entry: null` lawful). docs/PLUGIN-SERVICE.md owns both drive modes.
"Plugin service" is the core-routed mode;
never call it "service sidecar".

**A survival service uses UDS, not stdio.** Both drive modes above bind the service's lifetime to a pipe: a stdio
service dies when the spawner's fd closes. A **survival service** must outlive every
process that spawned it — `soksak-sidecar-terminal-alacritty` (§9) checkpoints shells that
themselves survive an app exit, so it cannot die with the app. It therefore does not use
stdio; it binds a rendezvous socket in the identity home and is reached over NDJSON on that
UDS, with a singleton probe on start and a detached spawn (`process.detached`) — the same
transport shape as the core PTY daemon it peers with. This is a distinct point on the wire
axis, not an exception to `soksak-spec-service`: that spec frames spawner-bound stdio
services; a survival service is reached by socket precisely because its reason to exist is
to not share the spawner's lifetime. Its own contract carries the message shapes
(`soksak-spec-sidecar-terminal`, provider `0.0.1`), the `hello` handshake isomorphic to the daemon's.

**Names never encode the model** (`soksak-sidecar-<name>` for both): the model is
machine-encoded (attachment path, artifact kind, ABI self-report); putting it in
the name would create a second, driftable truth.

## 2. Layout & naming

```
~/.soksak/sidecars/soksak-sidecar-{name}/
  dist/
    soksak-sidecar-{name}            # service model: executable (existing standard)
    soksak-sidecar-{name}.dylib      # engine model: the module
    ...engine runtime payload...     # e.g. framework + helper .apps (engine-owned)
```

- `{name}`: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` (used in path assembly — traversal-safe).
- No ambient env binary override — the identity home's `sidecars/` directory is the only
  resolution path (A17); dev stages into its own home via `stage.sh`.
- Diagnostics env belongs to the sidecar: `SOKSAK_SIDECAR_{NAME}_*`. Core env
  never carries engine names (NAMING.md).
- No PATH exposure; no `sok` registry surface. Both inherited from the original
  sidecar standard.

## 3. Engine hosting ABI — `soksak-sidecar-engine ABI` v1 (normative)

Two layers: the **hosting ABI** (u32 version, exact match — how any engine module
is loaded and driven; the core validates this) and the protocol contract. The
plugin is a consumer and declares `{ "id", "range" }`; the module is a provider
and self-reports exact `{ "id", "version" }` evidence through the two C strings
below. The core accepts the module only when the ids match and its strict SemVer
version satisfies the declared range.

Module exports (all `#[no_mangle] extern "C"`, every body `catch_unwind`-wrapped —
no unwinding crosses the boundary in either direction; a trapped panic returns -2):

```rust
#[repr(C)] struct SoksakSidecarEngineAbi {
    abi: u32,                 // hosting ABI version — core accepts exactly 1
    interface_id: *const c_char,      // e.g. "soksak-spec-sidecar-browser"
    interface_version: *const c_char, // e.g. "0.0.1"
}
fn soksak_sidecar_engine_abi() -> *const SoksakSidecarEngineAbi;    // self-description handshake
// The model declaration IS the symbol family itself: exporting soksak_sidecar_engine_* = engine
// model. No model field — a field restating what the symbols already prove could drift.

#[repr(C)] struct SoksakSidecarEngineHost {
    abi: u32, ctx: *mut c_void,
    emit: extern "C" fn(ctx, json: *const u8, len: usize),  // module→host event (any thread)
    log:  extern "C" fn(ctx, level: i32, msg: *const u8, len: usize),
}
fn soksak_sidecar_engine_init(host: *const SoksakSidecarEngineHost, cfg_json: *const u8, len: usize) -> i32;
    // once per process, MAIN THREAD (host guarantees). cfg = {"name", "distDir"} only —
    // engine-specific paths derive from distDir (own-location resolution).

#[repr(C)] struct SoksakBuf { ptr: *mut u8, len: usize, cap: usize }
fn soksak_sidecar_engine_message(req: *const u8, len: usize, surface: usize,
                         reply: *mut SoksakBuf) -> i32;
    // opaque request → synchronous JSON reply (module allocates; host must call free).
    // surface = calling window's parent view (NSView as usize), host-injected on every
    // call; the module uses it only where its protocol needs it (e.g. create).
    // Callable from ANY thread — modules queue real work to the main queue internally.
    // Return: 0 ok, -1 protocol error (reply = {"error": ...}), -2 trapped panic.
fn soksak_sidecar_engine_notify(evt: *const u8, len: usize);   // host→module fact, fire-and-forget
fn soksak_sidecar_engine_free(buf: SoksakBuf);
fn soksak_sidecar_engine_shutdown();                            // app exit only, main thread
// Non-macOS deliveries additionally export a pump tick. On macOS the engine marshals its
// work onto the core's run loop through GCD; Windows/Linux have no such channel, so the
// core resolves this symbol at load and calls it from the Tauri run-loop callback (main
// thread = the engine's UI thread). The engine only does an atomic due-check unless work
// is scheduled, so per-event ticking is near-free.
fn soksak_sidecar_engine_tick();                                // non-macOS only, main thread
```

Host notifications (v1): `{"type":"surface-occluded","window":<label>,"occluded":bool}`;
`{"type":"surface-closing","view":<usize>}` — teardown-order contract: the host sends this
while closing the window (main thread), and the engine MUST close every child parented
to that surface before the window deallocates. A window never dies under a live engine view —
this rule structurally prevents the wedged-close class (a zombie window that stays in the
window list with a dead webview and unreleased project claims).

The host does NOT send it from inside the `CloseRequested` callback. Reclaiming children
there re-enters the window runtime while the event loop still holds the window map borrowed,
and the process panics (`RefCell already mutably borrowed`) — measured 2026-07-26: closing a
window that hosted a Chromium view killed the app. The host defers the close once instead:
the first `CloseRequested` prevents the close, the notification and child reclaim run on the
next main-thread turn, and the window then closes itself. The ordering the contract demands is
unchanged — reclaim still completes before deallocation — only the re-entrancy is removed.
— fanned out to every loaded module when a DOM overlay opens/closes over content.

Versioning follows the public SemVer contract. Provider evidence always carries
an exact version; compatibility belongs only to the consumer range. A
concatenated `name@version` string is not a discovery or handshake shape. New
host capabilities require a deliberately versioned ABI change or an enacted
optional-symbol rule; missing required symbols are never tolerated.
The `surface` parameter is ambient because every engine is surface-bound by
definition — a future pdf/video engine reuses this ABI unchanged.

Handshake order (core, on first `open`): dlopen → resolve **all** symbols (any
missing = refuse, no partial load — the symbol family's presence IS the model claim) →
`soksak_sidecar_engine_abi()` → check `abi == 1` → validate provider
`{interface_id, interface_version}` → match it against the plugin's
`{id, range}` requirement → `init` on the main thread (rendezvous, 10s timeout)
→ register. Every repeat `open` rechecks its requirement against the already
loaded provider before issuing a channel handle.

## 4. Lifecycle

- Loading is **plugin-driven**: nothing loads at app start; the first
  `app.sidecar.open(name)` loads. Loaded = enabled (no env gates).
- Engine modules are **never unloaded**. Chromium-class engines initialize once
  per process and live children reference module code — the core intentionally
  leaks the library handle. `close()` releases only the caller's event channel.
- Repeat `open` reuses the loaded module (new channel handle per caller).
- `soksak_sidecar_engine_shutdown` runs only at app exit (RunEvent, main thread).

## 5. Plugin declaration, permission, conformance

Plugins declare sidecars in the manifest (top-level, parallel to `libraries`):

```json
"permissions": ["sidecar"],
"sidecars": [
  { "name": "chromium", "interface": {
      "id": "soksak-spec-sidecar-browser", "range": "0.0.1" },
    "reach": { "fetch": { "url": { "darwin": "https://.../dist.tar.gz" },
                           "sha256": { "darwin": "<hex>" } } } }
]
```

- `"sidecar"` permission (caution): loads native code into the app process —
  strongest class, disclosed on the consent screen together with the declared
  names/interfaces.
- `app.sidecar.open(name)` is gated to declared names (undeclared = throw), and
  the declared `interface` is verified against the binary self-report at load —
  declared ≡ actual on both sides. Declared-but-never-opened is legal (lazy).
- `reach` is fetch-only (command/vendor are library-axis concepts). Omitted
  reach = dev staging expected (`make sidecar-<name>`).

## 6. Distribution

Install chain (all pinned): plugin install → `sidecars[]` declared → on first
`open`, `sidecar_ensure` provisions if the dylib entry is absent: download →
sha256 pin → unpack (bsdtar, preserves symlinks/exec bits) → entry check →
atomic rename into `dist/`. Any failure leaves the destination untouched.
The archive contains the **contents of `dist/`** at top level.

Dev: `make sidecar-browser-chromium` stages from the engine crate's build output;
`make sidecar-browser-chromium-archive` emits the pinned tar.gz + sha256 for the
manifest. Production signing/notarization of engine payloads is deferred and
tracked here: dev runs ad-hoc signed (the Chromium engine avoids the keychain
prompt via its in-memory profile).

## 7. Authoring an engine sidecar

Skeleton (see the `soksak-ai/soksak-sidecar-browser-chromium` repo — the reference
implementation; its dev checkout lives at the sidecar home):

```
soksak-sidecar-<name>/   (independent repo; dev checkout = the sidecar home)
  Cargo.toml          # cdylib (+ helper [[bin]] if the engine spawns subprocesses)
  src/lib.rs          # ABI surface: exports above, catch_unwind edges, JSON dispatch
  src/engine.rs       # the engine itself
  README.md           # provenance/attribution — the only docs where a consumed
                      # library's name may appear (NAMING.md §2)
```

Rules:
- The crate is standalone (own workspace) and tauri-independent — nothing tauri
  crosses the ABI. The host passes surfaces as raw handles and events go through
  the host vtable.
- Main-thread work is the module's responsibility to queue (the host guarantees
  main thread only for init/shutdown).
- Subprocess-spawning engines (Chromium) own a dedicated helper binary staged as
  macOS `.app` variants (base/Renderer/GPU/Plugin/Alerts) — Chromium launches
  renderers from the `" Helper (Renderer).app"` sibling bundle and fails
  silently without it.

## 8. Chromium engine protocol — `soksak-spec-sidecar-browser` provider `0.0.1`

Requests: `caps()→{modes}`, `create(x,y,w,h,url[,mode,scale,owner])→{id}`,
`devtools-open(inspectedId,screencast,x,y,w,h[,owner])→{id}`, `bounds(id,x,y,w,h)`,
`load(id,url)`, `reload(id,ignoreCache)`, `stop(id)`, `back(id)`, `forward(id)`,
`hidden(id,hidden)`, `focus(id)`, `close(id)`,
`eval(id,js)→{ok,evalId}` (host-initiated page JS; the js runs as an async
function body and must `return` a JSON-serializable value — the result arrives
asynchronously as an `eval-result` event; CSP-safe, no eval() in page context),
`stats()→{ids,surfaces:[{id,owner,offscreen}],dbg}`,
`popup-mode(asWindow)`, `query-reply(queryId,success,response[,errorCode,keep])`.

Ownership: `owner` tags the creator scope (`pluginId@workspaceWindowLabel`) and the engine records it —
the engine is the single truth for which surfaces exist and who owns them.
Consumers MUST reconcile from `stats.surfaces` filtered to their own owner;
never reap from a consumer-local ledger (ledgers get lost across reloads and
leave undead surfaces — observed live), and never close a surface owned by
someone else. A sidecar process is shared by workspace windows, so plugin id alone is not an
ownership boundary. Empty owner = untagged legacy consumer.
Events: `nav {id,url}`, `title {id,title}`,
`favicon {id,url,urls}` (content fact, same shape as title — url is the first
candidate, empty when the page has none so consumers clear stale icons),
`eval-result {id,evalId,ok,value}` (completion of an `eval` request),
`loading {id,loading,canBack,canForward}` (drives a consumer spinner / stop
button and back/forward enablement — fires on every load-state transition),
`popup-url {id,url}` (new-link routing when popup-mode is "tab"; `id` is the
source browser so multi-window adapters consume only their own),
`query {id,queryId,request}` / `query-canceled {queryId}` (page↔host bridge),
`surface-created {view,surfaceKey}` / `surface-destroyed {view,surfaceKey}` (windowed only;
`surfaceKey` is the exact public identity supplied to `create`, so a framework adapter can bind the
native pointer to the declared DOM slot without guessing from engine-local ids),
`cursor {id,type}` (offscreen only),
`resize-settled {id,viewport,coded,scale}` (offscreen only; emitted only after a coded frame
matches the requested logical viewport, so consumers can wait without polling).

### Hosting modes

`create.mode` selects the hosting mode (additive field; absent = `"windowed"`).
The mode never appears in artifact/interface/env names — it is protocol
vocabulary only (NAMING.md §5/§8).

- **`windowed`** (default) — the engine owns a native child view attached under
  the ambient `surface` and emits `surface-created`/`surface-destroyed` so the
  core folds it into hit-testing; input reaches the engine view natively inside
  DOM holes.
- **`offscreen`** — the engine renders off-screen and presents into a
  layer-backed view it owns, inserted under the ambient `surface` below the main
  webview. Rules:
  - `create.scale` (devicePixelRatio) sizes the backing store; `bounds` stays
    logical px, identical to windowed.
  - The pixel path never leaves the process: engine-internal GPU texture →
    engine-owned layer. Frame data must not cross the host vtable, IPC, or JS.
  - The engine does NOT emit `surface-created` — the view takes no part in
    hit-testing. The DOM cell above keeps every input event and the consuming
    plugin forwards input over the protocol (below). `cursor {id,type}` lets
    the plugin mirror the engine cursor onto the cell.
  - `surface-occluded`/`resize-gesture` notifies apply unchanged; occluded =
    painting pauses.
  - Frame driving: the engine invalidates off-screen surfaces while the render
    loop is active (during load / input / animation) so frames land through
    page load without a manual nudge; when activity settles the loop stops and
    the last frame persists on the layer (zero idle cost). Purely animated
    content therefore freezes on its last frame after the idle window until the
    next input — acceptable for v1.
  - Cell transparency: the consuming plugin's DOM cell and every ancestor up to
    the webview root must be transparent, or the hole shows the opaque DOM
    instead of the engine layer beneath the main webview.
  - One surface per view. Offscreen views share the window content view as their
    parent, so two surfaces with overlapping bounds stack and the older one
    occludes the active cell — navigation moves the URL while the pixels stay
    stale. The host re-mounts a view on reparent/re-activate; the consuming
    plugin MUST close the view's prior surface before creating the next and drop
    a create that a newer mount superseded. Never leave a view holding two.
  - Parking a view (tab unpark/park) does not close its surface — send
    `hidden(id,true)` when the cell leaves the viewport, or the parked surface
    keeps compositing over whatever is shown. `hidden(id,false)` on return.
  - Every id-addressed request works identically on offscreen ids, `close(id)`
    included (a windowless browser reaps through the normal CEF close — no native
    view to tear down); `stats` reports both modes.

Input forwarding (offscreen only; coordinates are surface-local CSS px):
`mouse(id,kind:"move"|"down"|"up",x,y[,button,clicks,mods])`,
`wheel(id,x,y,dx,dy[,phase])` — momentum phase is forwarded, never synthesized,
`key(id,kind:"down"|"up"|"char",code[,char,mods])`,
`ime(id,kind:"set"|"commit"|"finish"|"cancel"[,text,caret])`.
Composition text comes from the DOM's native IME (the cell's hidden editable),
bridged as `ime` messages — synthesizing key events to fake composition is
prohibited.

`caps` reports `{ok, modes:[…], version}` for feature detection before `create`;
a build without off-screen support reports `modes:["windowed"]` and consumers
must not send `mode:"offscreen"` to it. `version` is the resident-module
identity probe: a dylib replaced on disk never affects the already-loaded
module (§4 never-unload), so E2E must verify `caps.version` matches the
expected build before trusting results — do not assume disk state equals
loaded state.

Popup widgets (`<select>` dropdowns, autocomplete) ARE composited: PET_POPUP
frames land on a sublayer above the view layer, driven by on_popup_show/size
(view-local DIP rect, y-flipped into layer geometry). Remaining v1 offscreen
limitation (explicit, not silent): the engine context menu is not composited.
In-page UI (anchor-positioned popovers, the design-canvas pattern) was never
affected.
Diagnostics: `stats.dbg.framesPresented` counts presented offscreen frames
(0 while idle/hidden is correct — presents stop when nothing changes).

## 9. Terminal service — `soksak-spec-sidecar-terminal` provider `0.0.1`

An engine-neutral, domain-scoped contract for the terminal domain's restore service. The
contract carries the domain; the **unit** carries the engine — the browser-chromium symmetry.
Four engine units implement `@1` today: `soksak-sidecar-terminal-alacritty` (default),
`-wezterm`, `-vt100`, `-ghostty`. One engine unit runs behind a terminal plugin at a time,
selected by the plugin manifest.

The running unit is a **service-model survival sidecar** (§1): headless, separate process,
reached over NDJSON on a UDS in the identity home. It owns the terminal domain's screen work
— the VT mirror, ANSI serialization, and checkpoint policy — while the core PTY daemon
(`soksak-ptyd`) keeps byte survival, the raw ring with a monotonic sequence, the tee face,
and a content-agnostic sealed-blob store (ARCHITECTURE A13; RESTORE.md).

The contract text, its acceptance suite, and its benchmarks live in **`soksak-contract-terminal`**
(kind `contract` — NAMING §4a), never inside an implementation. Acceptance is decided by
**declared golden screen states**, not by another engine: a unit passes when the screen it
reports after feeding a fixture stream, and the screen it reports after feeding back its own
restore paint, both equal the golden, and no byte reaches the PTY during replay. Every engine
— the default included — is a candidate measured against that standard; none of them is the
standard.

- **Consumers:** the terminal plugin *family*, not one plugin — both
  `soksak-plugin-terminal-xterm` and `soksak-plugin-terminal-ghostty` declare the identical
  entry `sidecars: [{ "name": "terminal-alacritty", "interface":
  {"id":"soksak-spec-sidecar-terminal","range":"0.0.1"} }]`.
  One contract, one running engine unit, shared across
  the family — input is a raw byte stream and output is ANSI paint, so no consumer couples to
  the engine. The manifest's `sidecars[].name` is what selects which engine unit runs, and the
  core holds that to be true: a plugin asks for the unit its own manifest declares for a contract
  (`process.sidecarName(contractId)` — the versionless contract id string, since this is runtime
  identification, not a version-pinned requirement; the range lives in the manifest declaration and
  is resolved at fetch), and a spawn of an undeclared unit is refused. A bundle that
  hardcodes the name cannot win over the manifest — the publish-boundary conformance check rejects
  a `sidecar:<name>` literal in plugin code, and `scripts/e2e/terminal-unit-swap.sh` changes the
  manifest alone.
- **Two faces:** a *server* face — plugins request `rehydrate`/`coldPaint`/`status` for
  warm/cold restore — and a *consumer* face — the sidecar subscribes to the daemon tee and
  pushes serialized plaintext to the daemon's sealed-blob store; it never touches a key.
- **Discovery / spawn:** the consuming plugin spawns it through the `process` capability
  with the detached option; the core resolves `cmd "sidecar:terminal-alacritty"` via
  `resolve_sidecar_cmd` (frameworks/tauri/src/process.rs) to
  `<home>/sidecars/soksak-sidecar-terminal-alacritty/dist/soksak-sidecar-terminal-alacritty` —
  the identity home is the only resolution path (A17); no PATH, no `sok` registry (§2).
- **Failure:** sidecar death leaves shells and the live path untouched (the daemon owns
  byte survival); only restore fidelity degrades, announced loudly, with a fall to the seal
  path (the plugin fetches the sealed blob from the daemon and opens it with the app vault)
  and a respawn. Never silent.
- **Engine:** each unit names its VT state machine and carries that engine's attribution,
  exactly as Chromium's does in `browser-chromium` (NAMING §2/§5) — `alacritty_terminal`
  (Apache-2.0), `wezterm-term` (MIT), `vt100` (MIT), `libghostty-vt` (MIT). The **contract**
  stays engine-neutral, so a replacement engine ships as its own unit implementing the same
  `@1`. A unit links its own engine only: the acceptance suite lives in the contract repo and
  is a dev-dependency, so no engine is compiled into another engine's unit.
